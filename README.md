# Welcome to the Breakfast Club

Welcome to Breakfast Club, our study group where we work on building an app each day. In this repo, youâ€™ll find a bunch of useful resources, boilerplate code to get you going with your projects and more.

Feel free to submit a PR and add more resources in the appropriate folders.


### Boilerplate
A few starter directories for common stacks such as MEAN, MERN, etc.

### Workflow Resources
A generic readme listing all the useful workflow tools we've stumbled upon.

### Oh, I Didn't Know That... But Now I Do
Any interesting tidbits or observations that someone else will find useful.
